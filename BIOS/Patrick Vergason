Elevator Pitch :)

My name is Patrick and I'm in the IT program here. I plan to be a website developer, so that's my biggest strength.

Experienced in:
    C#
    HTML/CSS

Worked with:
    JavaScript
    JQuery
    Java
    C++
    Python

I'm most comfortable when there's a lot of defined attributes (requirements, design). It helps to have something to look back to, base outlines, and make it easier to fulfil these attributes.
